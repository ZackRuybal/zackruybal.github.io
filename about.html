    <p>My name's Zack Ruybal, and I've been working in front-end web development and design for just over three years. The most important part of a website is the design and how people can interact with it. If the website doesn't catch the person's eye, and the experience is riddled with problems, people tend to not want to come back. But, in my experience, if the website looks good, and if it's functional and does what it says it'll do out of the box, I tend to trust the place of business for reliability in whatever they're providing.</p>
